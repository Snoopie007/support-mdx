---

The Payment Received trigger is designed to act as a centralized mechanism for capturing all incoming payments across the CRM, including one-time purchases, subscription charges, invoices, and more. It can be customized with filters, such as source type and transaction status, to target specific use cases. This trigger helps businesses automate tasks, streamline processes, and efficiently respond to real-time customer transactions.

### What is the Payment Received Workflow Trigger, and what does it do?

The Payment Received trigger automates processes and actions based on incoming payments when used in a workflow. It can be configured to respond to specific payment events, such as successful or failed transactions or particular products and payment sources. Here are some detailed functionalities and use cases:

**Workflow automation:** The trigger initiates the Workflow whenever a payment is received, allowing for automated actions like sending confirmation emails, generating invoices, or updating customer records in a CRM.
**Customization with filters:** Users can apply various filters to the trigger, such as transaction type, payment source, or product. This enables the creation of targeted workflows for specific scenarios, like subscription renewals, or failed payments.
**Real-time response:** The trigger operates in real-time, enabling businesses to respond quickly to customer transactions. This can help improve customer satisfaction by providing immediate feedback or resolving issues promptly.
**Conditional actions:** By using if/else conditions in the Workflow, different actions can be executed depending on the payment characteristics, such as the amount, source, or transaction status.
**Reporting and analytics:** The trigger can capture payment data for analysis and reporting purposes. By monitoring incoming payments and their attributes, businesses can gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and potential areas for improvement.

### What are some excellent usage cases for this, along with their benefits?

The Payment Received trigger offers numerous usage cases and benefits, helping businesses automate processes, improve customer experience, and gain insights from payment data. Some common usage cases and their benefits include:

-   **Automated payment confirmation:**  
    Usage Case: Send customers automated confirmation emails or messages when Payment is processed.  
    Benefits: Enhances customer experience by providing instant payment confirmation, reduces manual tasks, and helps maintain clear communication with customers.  
    
-   **Subscription management:**
   Usage Case: Automatically update subscription status in the system when a subscription payment is successful or failed.  
    Benefits: Ensures accurate and up-to-date subscription information, streamlines subscription management, and reduces manual intervention.      
    
-   **Dunning management:**  
    Usage Case: Automatically trigger dunning email sequences for customers with failed subscription payments.  
    Benefits: Improves revenue recovery by addressing payment failures promptly, reduces churn, and enhances customer retention.   
    
-   **Customer segmentation:** 
    Usage Case: Use payment data to create customer segments based on purchasing behavior, such as high-value customers or frequent buyers.  
    Benefits: Enables targeted marketing campaigns, helps identify upsell or cross-sell opportunities, and facilitates personalized customer experiences.      
    
-   **Payment failure resolution:**  
    Usage Case: Automatically notify customer support or sales teams to address and assist the Customer when a payment failure occurs.  
    Benefits: Enhances customer support, improves customer satisfaction, and helps resolve payment issues quickly.    
    
-   **Sales performance tracking:**  
    Usage Case: Monitor payment data to track sales performance and identify trends, such as best-selling products, seasonal fluctuations, or customer preferences.  
    Benefits: Provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making, helps optimize sales strategies, and drives revenue growth.      
    
-   **Integration with accounting systems:**  
    Usage Case: Automatically update accounting records with payment information using outbound webhooks, such as invoicing, revenue recognition, or tax calculations.  
    Benefits: Ensures accurate financial reporting, streamlines accounting processes, and reduces manual data entry.      
    
-   **Handling trial period transactions:**  The Payment Received trigger effectively manages transactions involving trial periods for subscription products, such as a 14-day trial. In this example, when a customer signs up for the trial and pays $0 upfront, the trigger categorizes this as a customer present transaction since they are on-session and entering their payment information. After the 14-day trial ends, the customer is charged $100 automatically without entering their payment details again. This subsequent transaction is considered a customer-not-present transaction, as it occurs in the background. The Payment Received trigger allows businesses to track and automate workflows around trial period transactions accurately.
    
Benefits: By efficiently handling trial period transactions, businesses can enhance customer experience, improve subscription management, and reduce manual intervention, increasing customer satisfaction and retention.
    
-   **Integrating Text2Pay links:** The Payment Received trigger supports Text2Pay links as a payment source, enabling businesses to automate workflows for payments received through text message-based methods. By incorporating Text2Pay links in the trigger's configuration, businesses can effectively manage and respond to these transactions, improving the overall customer experience and streamlining payment processing.
    
Benefits: Utilizing Text2Pay links with the Payment Received trigger allows businesses to reach a wider audience, expedite payment processing, and simplify customer communication, ultimately leading to increased revenue and customer loyalty.

## FAQs

### Will this trigger include subsequent subscription payments as well?

Yes, the trigger will fire whenever a payment is received from the end customer directly on an order form submission and when the subscription is charged in the background.

### How can I achieve the trigger for successful subsequent subscription transactions?

Since the subscriptions can be created in a funnel or website, we can create a trigger for Payment Received and apply the following filters for achieving the use case. The source type is Funnel/Website. The transaction type is "Customer not present/subscription transaction."

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294599591/original/OrCqP9hHx0Hn9hTZVHZu36bkcArxNdWgPg.png?1682520656)

The payment status filter can filter successful or failed payments per the use case.

### What does the Customer present/first transaction mean and the Customer not present/subscription transaction?

We are categorizing the transaction type into two categories

-   Customer present /first transaction - This includes the transactions where the end customer is on-session and making the Payment. This consists of all one-time purchases and the first order placement for a subscription product.
-   Customer not present / subscription transaction - This includes the transaction types which run in the background after a subscription has already been created. For example, if a customer purchases a recurring product with a 14-day trial period. The transaction is done while purchasing the recurring product ($0 transaction in this case) would fall into the Customer present/first transaction. After 14 days, when the trial period is over, and you charge $100 for the recurring product, the $100 transaction would fall into the Customer not present/subscription transaction category.

### Will failed payments also be captured in this trigger?

Yes, by default, without any filters, the trigger runs upon successful and failed payment attempts. For specific use cases around success/failed payments only, we can apply the "Transaction status" filter and set it to either success/failed as per the use case.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294601007/original/F5rh94OpAzMdtC93c23wQ4pYrasZGL7irw.png?1682520974) 

### I have configured the trigger and selected a specific product in the filters. Does this mean that the trigger will fire off when that product is sold anywhere?

If you have configured the trigger and set the filter for a specific product, it will fire off only when that product is sold in funnels/website/invoices. Using the transaction status filter, we can define whether the trigger should work when the purchase is successful or the purchase is a failure.

### What is the sub-source filter?

When you select a source like funnels/websites/invoices, they can have sub-sources, like a payment from the funnel can be coming either via a one-step order form, a two-step order form, or an upsell. You can use these sub-source filters to define the Payment's origin.
