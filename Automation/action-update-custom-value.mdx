## Action - Update Custom Value 
The Update Custom Value Workflow Action is a powerful tool that automates updating custom values in the CRM. With the ability to update sub-account level custom values, this action has a far-reaching impact on managing and automating recurring services, subscription management, and more.

### What is the Update Custom Value Action in Workflows?

In the CRM, the Update Custom Value Workflow Action is a useful tool for modifying custom values within a sub-account. This action goes beyond just updating an individual contact's custom field and can have a broader impact. Custom values act as placeholders that can store and track different kinds of information at the sub-account level. By automating the process of updating these values, this action can also trigger other actions based on the updated information.

### What are some excellent usage cases for this with practical examples?

**Lead Source Tracking:**  Tracking the source of new leads by updating a custom value for each lead source. For example, if you use multiple lead sources such as Facebook ads, Google ads, and email campaigns, you can update a custom value for each lead source to track which sources generate the most leads.

**Referral Program Tracking:**  Tracking the success of a referral program by updating a custom value for each referred customer. For example, offer a referral program that rewards customers for referring new customers. You can update a custom value for each referred customer to track the program's success.

For example, if you have a sales team, you can update a custom value for each representative to track their sales performance and identify areas for improvement.

**Customer Engagement Tracking:**  Tracking customer engagement by updating a custom value for each interaction. For example, if you have a customer service team, you can update a custom value for each customer interaction to track engagement and identify improvement areas.

**Event Registration Tracking:** Tracking event registration by updating a custom value for each event registration. For example, if you host events, you can update a custom value for each registration to track attendance rates and identify areas for improvement.

**Customer Feedback Tracking:** Tracking customer feedback by updating a custom value for each feedback form submission. For example, if you collect customer feedback through surveys or forms, you can update a custom value for each submission to track feedback trends and identify areas for improvement.
