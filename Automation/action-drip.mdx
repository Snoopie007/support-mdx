#### Batch Size

The batch size can be set to a minimum of one and a maximum of ten thousand per batch.

#### Drip Interval

Drip interval can be set in minutes/hours/days ranging from one minute to seven days

#### Example

Say, 10k contacts enter a workflow, or 5k contacts proceed from the wait step to the next step. To control the high number of executions you can set a batch size of 50 and an interval of 10 minutes to allow 50 contacts to proceed to the next step every 10 minutes.
