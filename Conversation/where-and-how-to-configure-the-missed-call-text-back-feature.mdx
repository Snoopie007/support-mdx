**Please Note:**
>The missed-call-text-back feature will trigger an SMS notification for every missed call, even if the caller tries multiple times within a brief timeframe.  
  
>To avoid receiving multiple SMS notifications for missed calls, it is suggested to create and customize the existing recipe in workflows and personalize it to manage according to your preference (Try adding a 20+/- min wait for step, or filter using tags - 1st call, 2nd call, etc.).
