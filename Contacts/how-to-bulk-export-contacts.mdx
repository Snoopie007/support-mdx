## FAQs

**Q1: Can I export only specific data fields for each contact in the exported .csv file?**

You can customize the columns in the exported .csv file by selecting or deselecting specific data fields before initiating the export. This way, you can focus on the most relevant information.


**Q2: What happens if a contact's latest note exceeds 255 characters?**


Only the latest note of up to 255 characters is included when exporting contacts. If a contact's latest note is longer than this limit, it will be truncated to fit within the 255-character constraint.

**Q4: Is it possible to schedule automatic exports of contact data?** 

This feature is not available at this time.

**Q5: How do I import the exported .csv file into another contact management platform?**

Most contact management platforms provide an import feature that supports .csv files. You will need to follow the specific import instructions for the target platform, which typically involves mapping the columns in the .csv file to the appropriate fields in the new system.
