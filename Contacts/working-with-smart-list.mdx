Smart Lists are innovative contact lists that allow users to customize and filter contacts based on specific conditions, such as custom fields. 
You can select which columns to display, and the Smart Lists update in real-time as contact data changes. 
Moreover, they've been enhanced with advanced conditions that allow the inclusion of contacts added between the time an Email campaign is scheduled and when it's sent out, making it a dynamic and flexible tool for effective campaign management.
