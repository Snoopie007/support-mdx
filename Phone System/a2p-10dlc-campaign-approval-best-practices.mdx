## Forbidden use cases will result in Campaign rejection.

Make sure your A2P Campaign does not involve prohibited content such as cannabis, hate speech, etc., and that your use case is compliant with the  Messaging Policy. 

## Opt-In Guidelines

We checked the rejected campaign and found that the opt-in description lacks details, e.g., End users opt-in by contacting us via telephone, email, chat, messenger, etc.

More information than that must be provided to know what the end user will see since it has not been possible to test how the Opt-in works.

As per our carrier requirements, opt-in should follow the following guidelines.

### Website opt-in:

Please verify that opt-in meets  **CITA guidelines**. All methods of opt-in need to be listed. If opt-in is collected through a  **paper form or behind a login**, please provide a  **hosted link to an image of opt-in**. If opt-in occurs on a website,  **please provide a link to the website**. The website needs to have a privacy policy and terms of service. Ensure opt-in is not shared with 3rd parties. If the privacy policy for this business states that your customer shares user data to and from third parties. Please note this is against our policy. "Consent is only to be obtained from the individual consumer and not on behalf of another individual. Opt-in data and consent may never be shared, sold, or bought." You might get error 30007 when sending an SMS.

On the website form, Clearly state that submitting their phone number allows them to receive messages from your company. Include a checkbox for clients to indicate their agreement.  **Participation in text promotions should never be a requirement.** If your customer forces users to enter a phone number and check the box to consent to promotional text messages to move forward, you might receive Error 30007 for the SMS delivery. SMS opt-in must be optional.

### For the checkbox consent, You can type something like this as an example:

I agree to receive marketing messaging from [Company Name] at the phone number provided above. I understand I will receive 2 messages a month, data rates may apply, reply STOP to opt-out

Example:

**Website Posting (Support)**: Prominently display the phone number on your website so customers can find it and use it to opt-in for messaging. This can be done through support pages, contact sections, or call-to-action buttons. Make it clear that customers can use the provided phone number to opt in and receive messages.

**Keyword or QR Code** **Opt-In**: Use specific keywords or QR codes that customers can use to opt-in for messaging. Communicate the keyword or display the QR code in ads, social media posts, or physical materials. Instruct customers to text the keyword or scan the QR code to opt in.

**Please Note:**
>Please provide photos or screenshots for verification, showing where customers can find the keyword or QR code to opt-in.

## Ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Make sure you submit Campaign registrations with accurate and consistent data:

    <tr>
        <td>Best Practice</td>
        <td>Examples</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Consistency in  **brand**,  **website,**  and  **sample messages**</td>
        <td>If your brand name is  **Acme**, your website is  [**www.acme.com**](http://www.acme.com/), but your sample messages say, “Here’s your one-time passcode for logging into  [**www.contoso.com**](http://www.contoso.xn--com-9o0a/),” your campaign will be  **rejected.**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Consistency in  **email** **domain**  and  **company name**</td>
        <td>Your campaign will be rejected if you register a brand as LeadConnector Inc but provide an email address with the Gmail domain name. *Note that this check  **only applies to large, well-known corporations that should have dedicated email domains**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Make sure you submit  **real, working websites.**</td>
        <td>Indicating that your customers opt-in to your messages via the website, but providing a website address that does not work, will lead to campaign rejection.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Make sure the brand you register is the  **actual brand that you’re sending messages for**</td>
        <td>If ISV customers register a brand with your company’s information (e.g., a company that  **provides the tech for dental offices**) but end up sending messages for your customers (e.g.,  **individual dentist practices**), your campaign will be rejected.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Make sure you create  **as few duplicative brands and campaigns as possible**</td>
        <td>**Excessive**  brands with the  **same EIN and excessive campaigns**  with the same campaign attributes may be seen as  **high-risk**  and may result in campaign rejection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>If you wish to send templated messages, please  **indicate the templated fields in sample messages with brackets**  to help reviewers better identify which parts are templated.</td>
        <td>For example, please write, “Dental check due for  **[Mary Doe]**, Visit  **[[www.contoso.com](http://www.contoso.com/)]**  to schedule an appointment or call  **[123-456-7890]”**</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Ensure your use case involves consumer consent before sending messages

Make sure you collect consumer consent appropriately. Please refer to the  [CTIA guidelines](https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/190719-CTIA-Messaging-Principles-and-Best-Practices-FINAL.pdf)  for detailed instructions and best practices on handling consumer consent.
  
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Best Practice</td>
        <td>Examples</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Make sure consumer opt-in is collected appropriately</td>
        <td>If you indicate you collect opt-in via text messages, but your sample messages say,  **“**Hi, is this the owner of 123 Oak Street? I’d like to discuss how I can help you sell your property”**, it is clear that you  **have not collected appropriate consent**  before sending messages and your campaign will be rejected.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Make sure  **opt-in language**  is available on your website if you indicated in the “message flow” field that a consumer opts into your campaign on your company website.</td>
        <td>If your brand Acme uses its website,  [www.acme.com](http://www.acme.com/), to collect phone numbers but your website does not contain opt-in language such as  **“By providing your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from ACME. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies.”**, your campaign will be rejected.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>We recommend having  **opt-out language**  in at least one of your sample messages.</td>
        <td>For example, please add language such as **“Please reply STOP to opt-out”**  in one of your sample messages.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

**Please note:**
>The ecosystem constantly improves the vetting criteria as it comes across additional violations. Please do not consider the best practices listed above as a “catch-all” and guarantee approval as long as you follow them all; instead, consider them as a baseline that illustrates the general direction of compliant, high-quality messaging that the ecosystem is moving towards.

-   Verify the accuracy and completeness of the registration information for the Sole Proprietorship Brand.
