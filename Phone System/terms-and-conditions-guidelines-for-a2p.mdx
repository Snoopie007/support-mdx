# Terms and Conditions Guidelines for A2P 

## Industry Standards for US Short Code Terms of Service

To ensure your short code campaign aligns with LC Phone's requirements, your company must adhere to carrier compliance requirements, industry standards, and applicable law.

As per industry standards, it is necessary to have a publicly accessible mobile terms of service page for each US short code program. These mobile terms of service should include specific provisions such as customer support contact information, complete opt-out instructions (displayed in bold), a recurring message disclosure (if applicable), a product description, and a program (brand) name. Additional requirements may exist for certain programs like sweepstakes or contests. For more information on industry standards, please refer to the  [CTIAâ€™s Short Code Monitoring Handbook](https://www.wmcglobal.com/us-resources).

Beyond these standards, there may be additional compliance requirements under applicable law based on the nature of your text messaging campaign. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that your terms of service and privacy policy are compliant with applicable law and consistent with standards for your specific campaign and industry.

## Enclosed is a copy of the boilerplate terms of service covering minimum requirements from the carriers:

**Program Name**

1.  Insert program description here; **{a brief description of the types of messages users can expect upon opting in.}**
2.  You can cancel the SMS service at any time. Simply text "STOP" to the shortcode. Upon sending "STOP," we will confirm your unsubscribe status via SMS. Following this confirmation, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. To rejoin, sign up as you did initially, and we will resume sending SMS messages to you.
3.  If you experience issues with the messaging program, reply with the keyword HELP for more assistance, or reach out directly to  **{support email address or toll-free number}**.
4.  Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
5.  As always, message and data rates may apply for messages sent to you from us and to us from you. You will receive  **{message frequency}**. For questions about your text plan or data plan, contact your wireless provider.
