Class Calendars are designed to manage one-to-many events where multiple invitees can attend a single booking. These calendars are ideal for webinars, workshops, training sessions, and sports events. In a Class Calendar, there can only be one appointment owner, typically the trainer or host. The number of spots per slot can be set, with a maximum limit of 9,999 attendees, though meeting location limitations do apply.
