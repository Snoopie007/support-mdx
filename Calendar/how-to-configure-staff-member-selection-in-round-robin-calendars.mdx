## How to configure Staff Member selection in Round Robin Calendars? 

Our booking widget includes a popular feature: Staff Member Selection. This function lets your clients select their preferred staff member when making appointments, offering a personalized touch to their booking experience.

## **What is the Staff Member Selection feature in Round Robin Calendars?**

The "Staff Member Selection" feature significantly enhances your booking system, specifically designed to increase the flexibility and personalization of your service offerings.

Primarily, it operates within the framework of the Round Robin calendar system in conjunction with the Neo widget type. When this feature is enabled, a dropdown menu appears on the booking widget, which lists all the team members who are part of that particular Round Robin calendar.

This opens up a new layer of choice for the end users, the appointees. They can now select a specific staff member while scheduling an appointment, thus allowing them to choose who they wish to interact with during their appointment.

This feature has been carefully designed to accommodate scenarios where a selected staff member may be unavailable. In such instances, a message will be displayed to the user indicating the unavailability and suggesting the next available slots.

Moreover, it fully supports the rescheduling of appointments. During this process, the user is shown the staff selection again, allowing them to either stick with their original choice or opt for a different staff member.

### **What are some practical usage cases for this feature?**

Here are some usage cases that highlight the versatility and potential benefits of the "Staff Member Selection" feature:

**Beauty Salons & Spas:**  This is where the feature can be most commonly used. Clients often develop a preference for a particular stylist or therapist based on their past experiences. They can easily select their preferred staff member when making their next appointment, ensuring a more personalized and satisfying service.

**Fitness Centers & Personal Training:**  Fitness clients often prefer working with a specific trainer who understands their needs, goals, and fitness level. This feature allows members to book sessions with their preferred personal trainer, fostering a stronger client-trainer relationship and improving client retention.

**Healthcare Providers:** In healthcare settings like clinics or hospitals, patients may feel more comfortable seeing a specific doctor or therapist due to rapport, trust, or specialty. The feature allows patients to select their preferred healthcare provider while booking an appointment, thus improving patient satisfaction and continuity of care.

**Educational Institutions & Tutoring Services:**  Students or parents may prefer certain tutors based on their teaching style, expertise in a subject, or rapport with the student. This feature enables them to select their preferred tutor while scheduling a session.

**Professional Services:** For businesses like law firms, consultancy agencies, or financial advisors, clients may prefer to work with a specific professional whose advice they trust or who has specific expertise. This feature lets clients choose their preferred professional when scheduling a meeting.

**Home Services:** In this industry, trust plays a vital role. If customers have had a good experience with a particular technician or professional, they might prefer the same person for future services. This feature allows customers to select their preferred professional, improving customer satisfaction and trust.
