You may have heard of the term “recurring billing/invoicing.” It is a way for your customers to pay you automatically without having to manually enter their payment details every time they buy something from you.

This can be very useful if you sell products on a subscription basis; you may want to send them an invoice every month or so for the amount due in advance.

This article will show you how to set up and use a simple recurring invoice.

### What is a recurring invoice?

A recurring invoice can be scheduled in advance to send automatically to your customers who bought a recurring service/product. You want to schedule the invoices once and forget it! You!  

**Please Note:**
>We recommend using Stripe Connect with Invoices, in the event you do not wish to use Stripe Connect payments would need to be manually recorded.

### How to create a recurring invoice?

-   Open the "**Invoices**" tab under the payments section.
-   Select "**New Recurring Template**" by clicking New on the All Invoices or Recurring Templates page.

-   The first invoice will be due on September 2 and would be sent 0 days in advance, i.e., on the same date.
-   The second invoice would be due on November 2 and sent to the customer on the same day.

-   If, in the above example, we want to send the first invoice starting from the next month itself but at an interval of 2 months only
-   Simply selecting the start date as August 2 would work for the required logic.
-   The scheduling will be complete after sending out three invoices to the customer as specified in the settings.

-   Settings provide a solution if we want to send out the invoice to the customer on the first Monday of every month starting from the next month.
-   The first invoice will be due on August 1 itself, given that August 1 is the first Monday in August.
-   The invoices will be sent one day in advance.
-   The logic also helps us end the process after the end of the year. This means the last invoice will be due on December 5, the first Monday of December.
-   No further invoices will be due for the customer after December 5.

-   This frequency setting would allow us to send an invoice to the customer on the last date of December every year, i.e., December 31
-   Invoice scheduling will end after sending out five invoices to the customer.

There can be  **four types**  of invoices status possible here, which will also be shown in the form of tooltips above the icons:

-   **Sent**: The invoice was successfully sent to the customer
-   **Overdue**: The invoice was successfully sent on time but has still not been paid by the customer
-   **Paid**: The customer has paid for the invoice
-   **Not** Sent: There was a system error in delivering the invoice to the customer, and the invoice needs to be sent again.  

The invoice statuses can also be checked inside the invoice builder once the recurring template is  **Scheduled**, which will open the right panel similarly.
