#### Will the successful invoice payment notifications still go to my customers even if I enable sales receipts?

No, if automatic sales receipts are turned on, customers would be receiving the template used for sending receipts and the option to set a template for invoice payment success notifications would not be available. We recommend using the sales receipts for invoice payment notifications
