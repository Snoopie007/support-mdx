## How to Schedule Posts in Bulk on the Social Planner CSV

Scheduling Social Media posts in bulk with the help of a CSV file can be the most optimal time-saving technique for scheduling in advance for the social journey. CSV is a “comma-separated values” file that allows you to save your information in a structured way.

### Bulk Scheduling Posts on the Social Planner:

As your Social Media Marketing grows and you have to post across various Social Media Platforms on a larger scale without manually doing it post by post, the Bulk Scheduling posts on the Social Planner capability will allow you to do just that.

You will need to make sure that the CSV file you import into the Social Planner follows a set of prerequisites.

### Pre-requisites:

This explains in detail how your CSV needs to be set up before you can import it into the Social Planner to bulk schedule posts.

**1. Date and Time Column:**

In this column, you can type in the date and time when you want to share your post. In this column, you must format the date exactly how you see it at the top of the column: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (One space between the date and time). If the date column is empty, it will be considered in the Draft.

The Column Header of this column must be exactly as mentioned in the Sample CSV as shown in the video,

it should be as follows:

postAtSpecificTime (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss)

It is highly recommended to have all the scheduled times be at least 10 minutes after the time when you are

uploading the CSV.

**For example**, if the scheduled date/time for the post is **2023-10-14 15:00:00**. This means that the CSV should be

uploaded no later than  **October 14th, 2023 at 2:50PM**.

**Please Note:**
>The schedule time formatting works in 24-hour format, not 12-hour. If you have difficulties with this, you can use [this tool](https://www.ontheclock.com/convert-military-24-hour-time.aspx) for assistance.

**2. Content Column**

In this column, you can type in or paste what you want to appear as the caption of your post, you can add

Hashtags too. The Column header of this column should be written as follows:

*content*

**Please Note:**
>Facebook Page/Group - 62000 characters  
Business Instagram Account - 2200 characters  
LinkedIn Page and Profile - 3000 characters  
Twitter Profile - 280 characters  
GMB Location - 1500 characters

**3. Preview link:**

In this column, you can type the URL or paste the URL that you want to appear as the link preview of your post.

The Column header of this column must be written as follows:

*link (OGmetaUrl)*

**Please Note:**
>If the other media rows like images, GIFs, or Videos are filled in, they will override the link(OGmetaUrl). It will be appended to the content column as a link.

**4. Image Url**
